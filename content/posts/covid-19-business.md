I don't usually  complain much about injustices  I am victim
of from time  to time, but the latest one  scorched me right
in the heart.  So I am  about to question a number of things
happening in this weird era I am living in.

If you read french and often read my ramblings on this blog,
then    you   know    from    my    [last   post]({{<    ref
"/posts/2020/07/farewell-andy"}})  that  my father  recently
passed away in Cameroon. I  wasn't able to travel back there
from  my  current  place  of   residence  (UK)  due  to  the
restrictions imposed worldwide in  an attempt to contain the
spread  of the  virus. Until  countries started  to open  up
their borders again and start to do what appears to me to be
"Covid-19 business".

It all started with Cameroon asking  to be able to present a
valid negative  covid-19 test, not  older than 72h  from the
time the test was taken, in  order to enter the country. For
travellers holding  a non-Cameroonian passport, the  same is
asked from  them to obtain  the Visa. Okay, fair  enough, we
all  want  to get  rid  of  the  virus,  so no  problem  for
presenting a valid negative  test result before entering the
country.   But  why  is  it   also  mandatory  in  the  visa
application,  which  one will  necessarily  need  to do  way
before they actually  book a flight? In any  case, the rules
are  the rules,  and  any law  abiding  citizen must  follow
them. So  I started thinking  about organising myself  to be
able  to go  to  Cameroon,  pay my  tribute  to my  deceased
beloved dad,  and try to  move on  with my new  life without
him.

Enter the  UK's NHS. They did  a very good job  at making it
possible for people to get the  PCR test at home "for free":
you order a test kit which  is shipped to your home address,
you take the swab yourself and  ship it back to them. In 48h
max, you  get your result.  In  order for my partner  and my
daughter to  come with me,  we needed  to order 3  test kits
twice (one for getting a visa, and one for the trip itself),
given  the  timing  between   Cameroon's  policy,  its  High
Commission  opening schedule  in  London (Visa  applications
from  monday  to  thursday  mornings)  and  the  theoretical
delivery  time  of the  NHS  test  results.  I  didn't  feel
comfortable  doing that,  worried about  maybe me  getting 6
test kits would  prevent other people to get  them. But hey,
what other choice did I have here? The alternative was to go
"private"  and  pay   150  GBP  (!)  times   3!  -  Covid-19
Business.  Anyway, so  we  got tested,  the  first time  and
received the result by e-mail and text message.  That's were
our problems started: the email received did not mention the
date the swab was taken. Although  the day we did it, we had
to fill a  form online were they ask you  about the date and
time you  are taking  the swab. Was  this only  a decorative
process then? In any case,  we proceeded to asking the visa,
which we actually got right away, after paying 150 GBP times
3 (At this point, if we had taken the private test, we would
have been at  nearly 1k GBP of expenses  already, not taking
into account the  flight price).  Anyway, fine,  even if the
e-mail doesn't mention the date, the High Commission accepts
it.   So we  went on  doing the  second test  for the  trip,
saying to ourselves: "If the  High Commission gives the visa
with this result, then we should be able to get on the plane
with  it."   Test  done  on Saturday,  results  received  on
Monday, Flight booked for Tuesday, all done.

Tuesday morning, we  arrive at Heathrow for  checking in our
luggages with Brussels Airlines, the cheaper flight we found
(1.5k GBP for the 3 of  us, with the minimal setting: normal
economy class, one bag each plus one additional bag overall,
one cabin bag each, no right  to choose our seat). when they
look at the test results,  they start asking questions about
the  test date,  raising the  exact same  concern I  already
had. They make some calls, and conclude that the test result
is OK,  and tell us  that they have  put a comment  on their
system so  that we  don't have  problems for  our connection
flight  to Douala  at  Brussels. We  embark,  and arrive  at
Brussels. Right when we show  our test results for embarking
the second flight  there, they stop us, together  with a few
other people from  the UK (i.e with the same  problem as us)
and one from  Toulouse whose test was 4 days  old.  They say
our test  results are not  valid, that they have  called the
Cameroonian authorities who do not  accept that.  So I start
wondering  what kind  of  authority have  they called  which
invalidates what the Cameroon's  High Commission accepts?  I
will never have the answer to that question.  When they tell
us that  we cannot get in  the plane, I first  thought I was
dreaming. But then they said:  "there is a test centre right
here  in  the airport,  it  only  cost  67 euros".   Then  I
understood.  It's Covid-19 Business kicking in again.  Money
needs to  enter Belgium,  and it will  be taken  from people
travelling to  Africa -  not sure  if they  do the  same for
other destinations  where the restriction exists,  Italy for
example -  where there are restrictions  related to covid-19
testing  as  soon  as  they find  the  slightest  chance  to
invalidate their  tests results.  If  your test result  is 4
days older, you stay longer in Belgium and spend money there
(covid-19  test,  public  transport or  taxi,  hotel,  food,
drinks, etc.), because Cameroon's rule says not older than 3
days. If there  are 3 flights like that in  a week and there
are around 10 people in  that situation each time, let's say
transport, hotel, food and drink for 2 nights and 2 days are
roughly 300 euros, that's nearly  10k euros taken from "poor
african" each  week - yes,  the 99% of people  travelling to
Africa  from Europe  are africans,  at least  originary from
there..  Okay, at the scale of Belgium, that might represent
nothing, but what about  these individuals spending all this
money they didn't plan to spend there?  That's making Africa
10k euros / week poorer than it would have been if these 100
people had made it to their destination country! So even
