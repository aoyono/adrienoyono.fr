You've reached the blog of Oyono. Welcome !

My name (Oyono) is from a central african language called `Bulu <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulou_(peuple)>`_ and
literally means "Morning dew".
I am passionated about a lot of things (airplanes, dance, science, history, economics, reading, ...).
I write Python code for GIS (Geospatial Information System) at `CS <https://www.c-s.fr/>`_
