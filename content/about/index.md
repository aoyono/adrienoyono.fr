You've reached the blog of Oyono. Welcome !

My name  (Oyono) is from  a central african  language called
[Bulu](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bulu)  and literally
means "Morning dew".  I am  an Aerospace Engineer.  I turned
into     a     Programmer      after     discovering     the
[Python](https://www.python.org/)  programming  language  in
2014 while developing a 6 DoF flight simulator for my end of
studies  internship.  I  am passionated  about learning  new
stuff.   My  main  interests generally  include  philosophy,
science (mostly  physics, maths and the  likes), programming
languages and economics.  I also  love cuban salsa.

I curently  work at  the [European  Centre for  Medium Range
Weather  Forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int/)   where  I  help
scientists get the best  satellite observation data to model
how   the    Earth's   weather    looked   like    [in   the
past](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview). That
said, you should  never consider what I say  on this website
as reflecting my employer's point  of view. This website and
its content only reflects **MY own**. Please, respect that.
